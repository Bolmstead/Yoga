<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project serves as the Capstone 1 project for the Springboard Software Engineering Course. This code will hopefully operate as a website for the Lunchtime Yoga for Business Professionals group in the near future. On this website, a user will be able to do the following:
* View information about the group including pricing, instructor bios, how to contact, and social media links.
* Create and log into an account with an encrypted password using bcrypt.
* Signup for available yoga classes using the website's calendar.
* View enrolled yoga classes and cancel their class enrollment.
* Edit their account information.
* (eventually) Receive automatic emails to confirm their yoga class signup, signup cancellation, or account creation.


Instructors will be able to do all of the above while having the authority to:
* Create/delete a yoga class.
* View who has enrolled for each class.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How to Run the Project

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

### Clone Repo

1. Clone the repo by clicking on the green "Code" button at the top of the screen or by entering the following in your terminal:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Bolmstead/Yoga.git
   ```
2. (optional but recommended) Create a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) in the same directory of the cloned unzipped code.

### Library Installations

3. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.txt.

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Postgres Installation

4. Install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).
5. Create a database named "yoga" in your terminal.
  ```sh
  createdb yoga
  ```
6. Start a server in your projects directory and you are done!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Possible features that I would like to integrate into the website are:
* Instructor can add any user to a class.
* User having a class credits column that would deplete after they attend a class and can be refilled by an instructor.
* Payment system to allow a user to pay/prepay for classes on the website.
* Google calendar API that would allow a user to save their class signup to their google calendar. Also to allow the instructors to save their created classes to their google calendar.

############# INCOMPLETE! Working to completely set up API. Account is currently under review. Once receive full access to my account again, I will uncomment the appropriate code in my app.py to get it working.


## Bugs to be fixed

A few bugs are still in the code and I am working to debug them:
* SendGrid Email API function is not currently working. It was working, however my account needs approval before automatic confrimation emails can be sent again. The email API code has been commented out and is located within app.py. Once working again, will uncomment code. 
* Calendar sometimes doesn't show the colored circle on date of class, however the classes are still populating to the calendar and show after the date is clicked.
* Timezones of the start and end times of the classes are saved to the database in the GMT timezone rather than MST. I have a Javascript workaround to correctly show the times in the calendar, but working to get the MST times in the database.

## Notes
For the sake of the capstone, any user can sign up to be an instructor on the website. This just allows anyone to view the instructor's functionality. If this website were to be implemented, instructors accounts would be created in a different way and require approval.

The source code for the calendar used on the website was pulled and maniputlated from [Simple Calendar](https://github.com/brospars/simple-calendar). Author of the Simple Calendar grants permission to any person to use, copy, modify, or publish the code. All documents regarding the Simple Calendar code are located in /static/calendar.
